# decChan

This is a really simple project that you can use for creating you own chan, is no that complex to implement.

For now its still in develop, but you can try it if you want, but the interface hasnt been implemented yet, so you can test it but the only thing that you will see is an array with objects.

I need to work more in the way the server check the connections but for now is not a big deal.

I love you guys, thanks for visiting this project.
Im open for improvements and critics.
